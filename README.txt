I sent over a few content please add that to the website. Can you make our logo bigger a lot bigger and the picture smaller. I need a tab button for dealerships and one for a work sheet. Don't need a pricing tab. Our contact page should only be a email. So the concept is they read our website fill out a form of what they want in detail. we respond to them within 48 hour to let them know we got them an offer. They go online and pay and we send them a certificate. We have to convince the customers to use our service. Each button they push should have a dramatic picture of a car or something to do with agent.. We want them to feel like we are their car agent just like they would use a real estate agent. Our regular fee is $99.00 but special for a limited time of $79.00

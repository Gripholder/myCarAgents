Once you fill out the form, you will get a email from us giving you the best deal. The price will only be good for that month you inquire so if you wait to long with the certificate we cannot gaurantee the deal. Each manufactor changes incenttive and rebates month to month. Some cases the incentives and rebates will stay the same but we cannot gaurantee the deal. Once you love our deal, you will submit a small fee on our click to buy button and you will receive your certificate with all the details you need to make your buying process simple and transparent while you save time and money. Cannot get any easier than that. <a href="contact-us.html">Give us a try</a></p>
